Having worked with Peter in many time-sensitive crunch situations, he never taps out early or makes excuses, but rather takes responsibility above and beyond expectations. In addition to a strong coding ability and laudable work ethic, his magnetic personality is an asset to any team and a catalyst for creativity and open discussion. I recommend Peter without reservation."
